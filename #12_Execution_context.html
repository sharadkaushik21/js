        //like lexical scope is for Compilation , Execution Context is for Runtime
        //In a program, If there is no function,then default is global 
        // Default Execution context is global
        //Each function creates a new Execution Context

        //if there is no function we have in Execution Context into Global Object, this and Lexical Envirnoment(OutSide fn)
        //      Global Execution Context

        //Every Function has a reference to it's current execution context called this
        //this is tricky and it's value depends on different conditions.
        //* this works during Runtime
        //* May considered as Dynamic Scope
        //Key to understand is how function is invoked, Not where is declared
